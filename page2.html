                    <h3>This is something I have always loved and hence travel is an activity that I have cherished for a long time. Travelling can be an exhilarating experience to me despite the place I visit being urban or rustic, I get to meet people from different parts of the world, get to experience their culture, tradition and way of life. My hobbies include travelling to new places and exploring them, tasting new meals and taking photographs. Besides, travelling expands my horizons and gives me a nice break from liabilities; thus, it continually energizes as well as inspires me in unmeasured ways.</h3>

                    <h3>one of the hobbies that I deal with and love is being an influencer. I enjoy giving my take on the things that I come across, whether it is the latest gadgets or the most scenic places to visit. I often get so glad to meet people who are interested in what I am and to influence their decisions positively. Influencer marketing isn’t merely about developing content – it is about establishing a community and interacting with the community in active ways. Either on YouTube, Instagram or live streaming in general it is creative and engaging and I love it.</h3>

                    <h3>I have always been involved in one or the other sporting activities more than I can recall. Whether it is the spirit of any soccer match or the silent intensity of a tennis match, I derive a lot of pleasure playing different sports. Not only do I benefit from being active through performing these activities but it also gives me a lesson in discipline, teamwork and perseverance. They present a different element of gameplay every time by which I am challenged and motivated to do better in the following games. One of the things I particularly like about sports is that they engender fraternity among people and one is able to make friends. In general, sports go beyond being only a passion for me – are the great lines that make my life colorful and vibrant.</h3>

                    <h3>I enjoy going to the gym as one of the activities that kept me engaged most of the time. This I have discovered work out not only assists in toning the body but also aids in increasing energy as well as concentration level towards my books. Be it carrying the weights, jogging on the treadmill or trying out a new set of exercise the sole purpose and fun of going to the gym for me is to escape the daily tension and stress and to find how much of myself can I take. It feels very good to see results or improvement and at the same time, to take care of ones health even with classes and personal matters.</h3>
